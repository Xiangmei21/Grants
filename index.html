<b>Intro:</b> Crater counting is a tool used by astrophysicists to determine the relative ages of two celestial surfaces by comparing the numbers of craters that can be seen in areas defined on the two surfaces. Most of such studies have relied on analysts to mark craters, recording their locations and sizes on high-resolution photographs of the surfaces. Crater counts can vary due to individual differences between analysts and even for a single analyst because of inevitable observation error. I have applied a Bayesian method to analyze a large real dataset consisting of crater observations by several analysts on an image of the moon's surface and estimate the real crater number on the area covered by that image. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated using a simulated data set (where "ground truth" is known and can be used to judge effectiveness).</p>
