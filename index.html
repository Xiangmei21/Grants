<b>Intro:</b> NSF and NIH are two of the largest public funders that provide awards for research and education in biomedical health, science and engineering. The US government gives billions in science grants each year through NSF and NIH. NSF accounts for about 20 percent of federal support to academic institutions for basic research. And The NIH invests nearly $32.3 billion in fiscal year 2016 in medical research for the American people. In this project, I analyzed NSF and NIH grants in 2017 and investigated the patterns of grants by state, institution, research field. To track the results of grants, I tracked publications under each grant number of NIH in PubMed database.</p>
